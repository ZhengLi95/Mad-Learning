# Mad-Learning

> The definition of knowing something is being able to explain it clearly. - S. Salsa

This repository is created for studying **Machine Learning**, by exchanging notes, codes, and more important, **ideas**. All forms of contribution are grateful; Besides, all the collaborators have **root** permission to this repository.

### Sort of Machine Learning

Machine Learning algorithm can be divided into three parts:

- Surprised Learning
  - [Linear Regression](/LINEAR-REGRESSION)
  - Logistic Regression
  - [Support Vector Machine](/SVM)
- UnSurprised Learning
- Semi-surprised Learning

Machine Learning problem can be divided into two main parts and the relevant algorithms are shown:

- Classification

  - Logistic Regression

  - [Support Vector Machine](/SVM)
  - [Principal Components Analysis](/PCA)
  - K-means
  - k-Nearest Neighbors

- Regression

  - [Linear Regression](/LINEAR-REGRESSION)

  - (TODO)
